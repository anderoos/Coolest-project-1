## Description

Using median sale price from Zillow, can we use historic sale prices to predict the best cities to move to in the next few years. 

## Data Sources 
Zillow and Census (to normalize prices with population)

## Approaches
* Calculate monthly moving averages of median housing prices across all cities and observe which cities move the slowest and fastest
- Use the data to predict how the cities will trend in the next few years
- How does seasons affect prices across states?
- Plot year over year growth of each metropolitan city
